## 🚀 Features

- ✔ 1. Blogger RSS Feed Fetch

Supports:

yourblog.blogspot.com

Custom domains (dpdns.org, qzz.io, .com, etc.)


- ✔ 2. Auto Image Extract

Automatically grabs the featured image from each Blogger post.

- ✔ 3. Beautiful Popup Reader

Tap on any feed item to open a full content popup with:

Scrollable content

Images, text, headings

Clean, mobile-friendly layout


- ✔ 4. Pagination

Navigate your feed easily using:

Next Page

Previous Page


(Each page shows up to 15 posts by default.)

- ✔ 5. Add-To-Home-Screen (PWA Install)

Fully installable on:
📱 Android / Chrome / Edge
Works like a native mobile app.

- ✔ 6. Offline Cache (Service Worker)

The UI (HTML, CSS, JS, icons) is cached offline after the first load.

> ⚠ Important Note:
If the user clears browser cache manually, PWA offline files are also removed
(which means offline mode will no longer work until the app is loaded online again).
This is normal browser behavior and not a bug.
